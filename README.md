# 👋 Hi there!

My name is Jessica, and I'm a software engineer based out of the Bay Area. I made the decision to transition from working in healthcare to becoming a software engineer back in 2022 and I've been enjoying the journey very much. 🏥 --> 💻

I’m a compassionate full-stack developer dedicated to leveraging technology for positive change. Combining a passion for helping others with my newfound enthusiasm for coding, I bring strong problem-solving skills and collaborative teamwork from my previous experience working in healthcare. With attention to visual aesthetics and a drive to continuously learn and grow, I am eager to make a meaningful impact through innovative solutions.
